* Remove *.q files from /dev/shm, No one needs them
* Eliminate all dependencies on *.csv file. Only generate per-thread logs
* PLug in all analysis into one module and generate one stats file
* Don't do everything again. There is no time.
* Remove padding from Mnemosyne (look for padding[32]) and see what happens. Does the cross-dep rate go up ?
