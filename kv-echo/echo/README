SWAPNIL:

Set FLUSH_IT macro in kp_recovery.h, which determines if clflushes are used instead of nops

The kp_store struct has a bool use_nvm which if true, uses extra flushing to make data durable.

From evaluation/evaluation.c :
/* These two parameters define whether or not we perform extra non-volatile
 * memory steps for the local stores and the master store: */
 bool use_nvm_local  = false;
 bool use_nvm_master = true;

Make clean after every change! The makefile is not written properly so might not work.

TODO: Clean up all the bugs marked todo by the original authors.

#PREPOP number is a macro hardcoded in evaluation.c, which determines number of prepopulated keys
