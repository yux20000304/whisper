This directory contains the "Gnulib" hash table, from:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/MODULES.html#module=hash
This hash table depends on a few other bits of code (bitrotate, xalloc-oversized), which are also found in this directory.

Possibly useful web page discussing some old performance caveats, etc.:

Search for "PJH" in the files in this directory to see where I made changes in order to resolve build errors.
