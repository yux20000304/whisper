## IMPORTANT
We are currently testing WHISPER in various environments.
PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Report issues and suggestions to Swapnil (swapnilh at cs dot wisc edu) or Sanketh (sankey
at cs dot wisc dot edu). 

Eliza is a tool to process traces generated by WHISPER applications.
You may use it or develop your own for your analysis.

## FAQs :

#### 1. For Nstore-{YCSB, TPCC} and Echo I get a runtime error that says "no free memory of size 128 available". 
#### What do I do ?

Nstore and Echo create a file in /dev/shm (zfile for nstore and efile for echo}
which act as persistent memory pools. So does every application in WHISPER.
The default size is 1GB. When space is low,
the above error is thrown. We will make this a run time parameter in the future. For now, simply increase it by altering the PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE
in Nstore and Echo. You may find this variable by using grep, cscope or any indexing tool for browsing source code. 
Its location varies with application. Delete the old pool, recompile and re-run. Suggested sizes are as shown.
Please pay attention to the format of defining the size i.e. XXX * 1024 * 1024 * 1024. This is in bytes.

~~~
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (2UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) // 2GB
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (4UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) // 4GB
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (8UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) // 8GB
~~~

You may also reduce the size as follows.

~~~
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (512 * 1024 * 1024) // 512MB
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (256 * 1024 * 1024) // 256MB
#define PSEGMENT_RESERVED_REGION_SIZE (128 * 1024 * 1024) // 128MB
